# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-SQL

📌 Overview

The Bank Customer Churn Analysis project aims to identify key factors influencing customer churn in the banking sector. Using SQL for data manipulation and analysis, this project provides actionable insights to improve customer retention and inform marketing strategies.

🚀 Why This Project Matters

Churn Reduction: Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

Data-Driven Insights: Understand why customers leave and take proactive steps to retain them.

Targeted Strategies: Develop marketing campaigns based on customer demographics and behavior.

📊 Key Objectives

✔ Predict Churn: Identify customers likely to leave.
✔ Customer Segmentation: Compare characteristics of churned vs. retained customers.
✔ Analyze Product Usage: Understand how different banking products impact churn.
✔ Demographic Insights: Examine how age, gender, and country affect churn.
✔ Retention Strategies: Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn.

📂 Data Sources

The analysis is based on four key datasets:

Customer Demographics (Age, Gender, Country, Salary)

Account Information (Balance, Credit Score, Tenure)

Product Usage (Number of Products Held)

Churn Data (Indicates if a customer has left)

🔍 Methodology

The project follows the CRISP-DM framework:

Business Understanding – Define project goals & stakeholder needs.

Data Understanding – Explore and clean datasets.

Data Preparation – Transform data for analysis.

Modeling – Use SQL for churn prediction & segmentation.

Evaluation – Validate insights with stakeholders.

Deployment – Provide actionable recommendations.

📈 Key Findings

Overall Churn Rate: 20.37% (higher among older customers & high-balance holders).

Product Impact:

Customers with 2 products have the lowest churn rate (7.58%).

Customers with 4 products have the highest churn rate (100%).

Demographics Matter:

Female customers churn more (25%) than males (16%).

Germany has the highest churn rate (37%), especially among females.

Balance Effect:
